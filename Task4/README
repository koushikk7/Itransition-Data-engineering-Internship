Bookstore Analytics Dashboard (Task 4)
This solution processes raw bookstore data (YAML, Parquet, CSV), resolves user identities using graph logic, and visualizes sales trends.

How to Run

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Launch the dashboard:
streamlit run dashboard.py

Verification Scripts
To ensure the dashboard numbers are accurate, I wrote three standalone scripts to cross-check the logic against the raw data.

Dashboard Screenshots
In case the live server is unavailable, I have included full-page screenshots of the results for all three datasets in the dashboard_images/ folder:
